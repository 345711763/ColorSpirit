# ColorSpirit
This react.js project is to create a bussiness website for an art studio
I am currently implementing some basic pages. A DrawableCanvas has been made to enable users to draw on every pages. Some related
functionalities like erasor and color picker will be added soon.

In the future, an e-commerce system will be integrated to allow art studio to sale and manage their student's works.

To run this project, use npm run start.
